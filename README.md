# DVI Viewer

An example React app showing how to decode and render `LuaTeX` `dvi` files using [dvi-decode](https://github.com/matjp/dvi-decode).

## Instructions

Either download the source and build the app yourself, or try it on Github Pages: <https://matjp.github.io/dvi-viewer/> (this build works only with Latin Modern fonts).

`DVI Viewer` works only with `dvi` files generated by `LuaTeX`, and with `luaotfload` package version >= 3.15.

Use the `dvilualatex` command to create the `dvi` file for your LaTeX source.

Use the `unicode-math` package if math mode is used.
